This is a simple marble game where you collect tea cans and explore the level!
Roll the marble around, check out the objects, and enjoy!

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR**
- Notice how the marble moves when you use WASD, depending on the camera angle
- HUD (text) display on the bottom left that shows how many collectibles to get
- Check the well-lit objects with correct normals!
- Watch what happens when you roll the marble off the track!

- Graphically, check out all of the original openGL
  objects I created and animated including:
   - Arizona tea can
   - Columns, Plants
   - Computer, keyboard
   - Parthenon
   - Cups
   - Secret Easter Egg Tape*

- I also imported 2 objects from Blender, including a Skull obj and Dolphin Obj

Remember you can navigate the marble around the scene to see more!
*you can collect this item as a secret once you get all the cans!
