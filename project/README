**WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is a simple marble game where you collect tea cans and explore the level!

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR**
Notice how the marble moves when you use WASD, the controls to zoom in/out,
and the HUD (text) display on the bottom left that shows how many collectibles to get.
Graphically, check out all of the original openGL objects I created and animated
including the Arizona tea can, plants, columns, computer, keyboard and Parthenon
Notice too how I included a skybox that doesn't clip!
Remember you can navigate the marble around the scene to see more!
Notice how the normals on all objects are correctly calculated!

**TO RUN:**
> make
> ./final

**KEY BINDINGS:**
  w/a/s/d      move marble N/W/S/E
  v/V          Reset marble position
  r/R          Reset game entirely (marble + cans)

  arrow keys   change camera angle
  +/-          zoom camera closer/farther
  x/X          toggle HUD (number of collectibles indicator)
  0            Reset zoom and view angle
  ESC          Exit


**WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE:
  - Fixing marble sphere texture
  - Set up light objects (currently it's default ball, for testing purposes)
  - More fun objects in scene (cassette tape, cups, more aesthetic windows, video game system, etc.)
  - A MUCH longer track to explore the level!
  (**stretch goals**)
  - Imported .obj objects from Blender (dolphins, greek statues)
  - Animate said objects
  - Proper ground/collision detection for the marble; reset game state if marble falls off track
