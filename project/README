**WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is a simple marble game where you collect tea cans and explore the level!

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR**
Notice how the marble moves when you use WASD, the controls to zoom in/out,
and the HUD (text) display on the bottom left that shows how many collectibles to get.
Graphically, check out all of the original openGL objects I created and animated
including the Arizona tea can, plants, columns, computer, keyboard and Parthenon
Notice too how I included a skybox that doesn't clip!
Remember you can navigate the marble around the scene to see more!
Notice how the normals on all objects are correctly calculated!
