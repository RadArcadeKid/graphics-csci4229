This is a simple marble game where you collect tea cans and explore the level!
Can you find the secret easter egg?

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR**
- Notice how the marble moves when you use WASD, depending on the camera
- HUD (text) display on the bottom left that shows how many collectibles to get.
- Watch what happens when you roll the marble off the track!


- Graphically, check out all of the original openGL objects I created and animated including
  - Arizona tea can
  - Columns, Plants
  - Computer, keyboard
  - Parthenon

Remember you can navigate the marble around the scene to see more!
